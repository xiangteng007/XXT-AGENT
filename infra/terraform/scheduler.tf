# Cloud Scheduler Jobs - Deprecated
#
# These scheduler jobs were designed to trigger Cloud Run services
# that are no longer deployed. All jobs have been removed.
#
# News collection is now handled by Firebase Functions (newsCollectorScheduled)
# defined in apps/functions/src/index.ts
#
# If you need to add new scheduler jobs for Cloud Run services,
# define them here with the correct service URI references.
