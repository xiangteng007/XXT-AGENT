# Pub/Sub Topics and Subscriptions - Deprecated
#
# This file previously referenced Pub/Sub resources for the AI ME pipeline.
# These resources may or may not exist in the current project.
#
# The topics/subscriptions were designed for:
# - raw.market: Market data stream
# - raw.news: News feed stream
# - raw.social: Social media stream
# - fused.event: Combined event stream
# - events.dlq: Dead letter queue
#
# If you need to manage Pub/Sub via Terraform, ensure the resources exist
# or create them first before using data sources.
