# Import blocks for existing Cloud Run services
#
# This file is currently empty because no Cloud Run services managed by
# this Terraform configuration exist in GCP.
#
# Active services (erp-api, light-keepers-api) are managed separately.
#
# When adding new services to cloudrun.tf, add import blocks here
# if the services already exist and need to be imported into state.
